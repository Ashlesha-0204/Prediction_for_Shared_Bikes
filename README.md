# Demand Prediction for Shared Bikes Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes for BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider. In the wake of declining revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BoomBikes seeks to understand the factors influencing bike demand. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of daily bike usage against various independent variables—such as weather conditions and seasonal trends—the goal is to provide actionable insights that can inform strategic business decisions.
